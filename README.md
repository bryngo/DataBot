# Discord Data Bot
## Motivations
- To get on lots of upvotes on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/).
## Current Progress
- Simple bot that doesn't do much

## Quick Start
1. Install node
2. `git clone https://github.com/bryngo/DataBot.git`
3. Create a file called config.json and give it the following contents:
```json
{
  "token" : "YOUR-TOKEN-KEY-HERE",
  "prefix" : "+"
}
```
4. Run the bot with `node main.js`
